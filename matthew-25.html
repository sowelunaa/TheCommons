                <p>Matthew 25 is a nonprofit organization in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that works to strengthen neighborhoods through comprehensive, community-driven revitalization. Founded in 2006 by brothers Clint Twedt-Ball and Courtney Ball, the organization began by offering reading assistance to elementary students in the basement of Trinity United Methodist Church. Since then, it has grown into a multifaceted organization with over 600 volunteers that has collectively invested more than $10 million in Cedar Rapids neighborhoods.</p>
                
                <p>The organization focuses primarily on the Time Check neighborhood and surrounding core neighborhoods on the northwest side of Cedar Rapids. These are areas that have faced significant challenges including flooding, lower incomes, and limited access to resources. The area has a 10 year difference in life expectancy and a $20,000 difference in household income at age 35 between these neighborhoods and more affluent areas of Cedar Rapids. Matthew 25 works to close these gaps through quality housing, healthy food, educational opportunities, and community building.</p>
                
                <p>Matthew 25 has many interconnected programs. The Cultivate Hope Corner Store is a nonprofit grocery store located in what was once a food desert, offering healthy food at affordable prices. Groundswell Cafe operates as Iowa's first and only pay-it-forward cafe, where customers can choose to pay full price, pay what they can afford, or receive a free meal. The cafe provides 20 free meals daily. The Cultivate Hope Urban Farm grows fruits and vegetables using sustainable practices and offers community garden plots. A tool library provides affordable access to equipment for home repair, gardening, and maintenance projects, with everything from ladders and saws to tile cutters and drywall jacks.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond these physical resources, Matthew 25 provides home repair assistance, affordable housing development and rehabilitation, youth education programs, and community-building activities. The organization responded to major crises including the 2008 flood that devastated the neighborhood and the 2020 derecho that destroyed 70% of Cedar Rapids' tree cover.</p>
                
                <p>What distinguishes Matthew 25 is its asset-based community development approach. Rather than viewing neighborhoods through a deficit lens, focusing on what's missing or broken, the organization identifies existing strengths and builds from there. The philosophy recognizes that even communities facing significant challenges have assets: skills, relationships, physical spaces, cultural knowledge, and people willing to contribute. Matthew 25 works to preserve and amplify these assets rather than imposing external solutions.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection-title">How to Build Something Similar</h2>
            <div class="how-to-build">
                <p>Starting neighborhood revitalization work in your community does not require replicating Matthew 25's full scale. The organization grew gradually over nearly two decades, beginning with one small program. Their approach offers valuable lessons for anyone wanting to strengthen their own neighborhood.</p>
                
                <p><strong>To help a neighborhood become steady and grow:</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Choose a focused geographic area:</strong> Select a specific neighborhood rather than trying to serve an entire region. Look for areas where you already have connections, relationships, or presence.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Identify existing physical assets:</strong> Walk around the neighborhood and notice what already exists: parks, community centers, schools, churches, local businesses. Look for underutilized resources: empty buildings, vacant lots.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Identify skill based assets:</strong> What skills do you already have that you may be able to use to better serve the community? Talk to others who may be interested in helping. What skills do they have?</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Build programs around available assets, not external needs assessments:</strong> Start with what you actually have access to rather than what you think the community needs. If someone in your group has gardening expertise, explore whether a community garden makes sense. If you have access to a building, consider how that space could serve the neighborhood. If volunteers have carpentry skills, home repair programs might be feasible.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Partner with existing institutions:</strong> Connect with schools, libraries, community centers, churches, or other organizations already present in the neighborhood. Look for ways to support or enhance what they're already doing rather than competing.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Start small and let programs grow organically:</strong> Begin with one initiative you can sustain: A tool lending program, community dinners, a small food pantry, home repair assistance, etc. Focus on doing that one thing well before expanding. Allow new programs to emerge based on relationships you build and resources that become available. Matthew 25 started with tutoring and grew over nearly 20 years into their current scope.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Respond to crises and opportunities:</strong> Be prepared to adapt when your community faces emergencies. When Matthew 25's neighborhood experienced flooding and a derecho, they pivoted to coordinate disaster response. These crisis responses often reveal new needs and build trust that enables longer-term work.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The biggest takeaway from Matthew 25's approach is that sustainable neighborhood revitalization grows from within rather than being imposed from outside. You don't need to diagnose problems and then seek solutions. Instead, start by understanding what already makes the neighborhood valuable. The skills residents have, the spaces that exist, the relationships that connect people. Then build programs that amplify these assets. This means avoiding the temptation to create a comprehensive plan for "fixing" the neighborhood. Instead, begin with one concrete thing you can do based on resources you actually have.</p>
