                <p>Rooted is a Madison-based nonprofit focused on building healthy, equitable, and sustainable neighborhoods through urban agriculture education, food production, and land access. The organization operates three urban farms and supports over 70 community gardens across Dane County, serving approximately 2,000 families.</p>
                
                <p>What distinguishes Rooted's approach is its emphasis on growing skills, relationships, and community knowledge as the foundation for food justice work. The organization does not just provide food or services. It teaches people to grow food themselves, connects growers with each other, and helps communities understand their specific local needs and assets.</p>
                
                <p>Rooted's urban farms serve multiple purposes simultaneously. They produce over 60,000 pounds of food annually for donation to food pantries and neighborhood centers. They function as learning spaces where students grow produce from seed, tend gardens year-round, and develop practical agricultural skills they can use anywhere. They employ youth through an urban agriculture program, building job skills while addressing food access. The farms demonstrate that food production, education, and community building aren't separate goals but interconnected parts of the same work.</p>
                
                <p>The organization's educational programming reaches students of all ages, from elementary school garden clubs to intensive programming for justice-involved youth. The Gardener-in-Residence program places experienced gardeners at schools not just to maintain gardens, but to teach students how to grow food themselves. Students participate in hands-on farming work where the food they grow goes directly to food banks, learning that their work directly supports their community. This instills principles of mutual aid and contribution at a young age while building practical skills.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond direct farming and education, Rooted operates the Community Gardens Network, providing training and support to help other people start and sustain gardens in their neighborhoods. The organization facilitates local food procurement for school lunch programs, connecting small growers with institutional buyers. Different programs incorporate mentorship models where experienced growers exchange knowledge for labor, spreading skills throughout the community rather than concentrating expertise in paid staff.</p>
                
                <p>Rooted specifically serves Madison's most diverse and under-resourced neighborhoods, but its approach is rooted in understanding the specific assets and needs of these places. The organization works in areas with good soil and available land, building from what exists rather than imposing solutions from elsewhere. Funding comes primarily from government grants, supplemented by farm stand sales, CSA memberships, and field trip fees. The work is grounded in equity and racial justice, ensuring that barriers to land access, fresh food, and learning opportunities are removed for all residents.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection-title">How to Build Something Similar</h2>
            <div class="how-to-build">
                <p>Getting involved in food justice and local food systems work starts with developing practical growing skills and a deep understanding of your specific community's needs. Rooted's approach offers a model for how food production, education, and community organizing can interconnect, but starting your own work does not require replicating their full scope.</p>
                
                <p><strong>How to feed your community:</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Develop your own skills:</strong> Before you can teach others or contribute food to your community, learn to grow food yourself. Start a home garden, even if it's just containers on a balcony or a small plot in your yard. Focus on understanding what grows well in your climate, what challenges affect your area, and what techniques work in your specific conditions. Experiment with different crops and methods. The practical knowledge you gain will be invaluable when working with others. Take classes, read books, watch videos, and learn from experienced growers in your area.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Explore:</strong> Don't assume you know what people need. Research and ask. Go to local food pantries, community centers, and social service organizations to understand where food access gaps exist. Learn which populations are underserved and why. Understand what kinds of food people actually want and will use. Identify what resources your area does and does not have. Madison has good soil and available land. What does your place offer?</p>
                
                <p><strong>Start sharing food and knowledge:</strong> Once you've developed growing skills and understand what your area needs, begin sharing what you produce with people who need it. Contact food banks, shelters, or community centers and offer to donate fresh produce. Share your growing knowledge informally: help neighbors start gardens, teach kids in your neighborhood, offer to help community members set up container gardens. The difference that the access of many home gardens can make can reach or surpass the difference of one large organization.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Focus on being "at home" where you are:</strong> Rooted's advice emphasizes understanding your specific place deeply: its soil, its communities, its needs, its resources. Don't try to replicate a model from elsewhere without adapting it to your context. Building deep local knowledge takes time but creates more sustainable, responsive work.</p>
                
                <p>The main takeaway from Rooted's work is that effective food justice organizing requires both practical agricultural skills and deep community understanding. You can't teach people to grow food if you haven't done it yourself. You can't address food insecurity effectively if you don't understand the specific barriers people in your community face. Start by becoming competent at growing food, then share that food and those skills in ways that respond to real, identified community needs. From there, partnerships and programs can develop organically based on what your specific place requires.</p>
