                <p>Madison Mutual Aid Network (Madison MAN) is a cooperative in Madison, Wisconsin, that creates alternative economic systems based on mutual exchange rather than money. Founded as part of the Humans United in Mutual Aid Networks (HUMANs) global cooperative, Madison MAN operates on a core principle that distinguishes it from traditional charity: reciprocity. Everyone both gives and receives, and no one is defined solely by their needs.</p>
                
                <p>The heart of Madison MAN is timebanking. Members exchange services and skills based on hours worked rather than monetary value. Every hour spent helping another member earns one hour's worth of credit, which can be spent on anyone else's time. Everyone's time is valued equally regardless of what work they do. This goes against the typical capitalist approach in which a doctor, for example, is paid much more for an hour of work than a childcare worker, inherently giving the doctor's time more value.</p>
                
                <p>Timebanking also eliminates the middlemen who typically profit from connecting people who need help with people who provide it. In the regular economy, if you need a website built, you'd hire through a company that takes a cut of the fee, or use a freelancing platform that charges the freelancer to be listed. With timebanking, you connect directly with someone who has coding skills, they help you for three hours, and they earn three hours of credit they can use for anything they need. No company taking a percentage, no platform fees, no one profiting from the transaction except the people actually doing the work.</p>
                
                <p>On top of one on one transactions, the timebanking system enables specific projects where members earn and spend hour credits. EveryWhere Gardens brings members together to work collectively on garden spaces for those who need help, with participants earning hours while building skills and sharing the harvest. The Health and Care Network coordinates care for members with disabilities, aging bodies, or illness through timebank exchanges. Beyond these projects, Madison MAN maintains common funds for emergencies, shared resources like tool libraries and meeting spaces, and hosts regular social events and skill swaps where members can learn about cooperative economics and build relationships.</p>
                
                <p>Madison MAN is governed cooperatively. Members have a say in governance and a stake in ownership. Weekly planning meetings are open to all members, with agendas ranging from planning social events to defining how savings pools work to discovering new ways to support neighbors locally and globally.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection-title">How to Build Something Similar</h2>
            <div class="how-to-build">
                <p>Starting a mutual aid network based on timebanking and cooperative exchange requires sustained social effort and genuine commitment to reciprocity. While you could start from scratch, the HUMANs network exists primarily to help others set up similar systems and to provide ongoing advice and support.</p>
                
                <p><strong>To start a timebanking network:</strong></p>
                
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Join the HUMANs network:</strong> Visit mutualaidnetwork.org to connect with the global network. Membership is paid through an hour of timebanking per month in exchange for an hour of help. There you can connect with experienced organizers who can help you navigate challenges and learn how to grow. You don't need formal membership to start, but it provides structure and support that can go a long way.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Spread the word:</strong> Timebanking is the engine that powers cooperative exchange, but it can be hard to start as the smaller your network the less skills are offered. Start small, just try to find a few people in your community who would be interested. Sometimes it is easiest to start with people who have skills that you personally value, as you can trade your time with them directly.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Create a framework:</strong> Set up a system where members earn hour credits for helping others and spend credits to receive help. Typically this is a website, but it can be as simple as a shared spreadsheet. It doesn't need to be expensive or time consuming.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Commit consistently:</strong> Mutual aid isn't occasional volunteering. It requires showing up regularly like a job. Expect initial enthusiasm to fade. Plan for sustained engagement. Be honest that this is real work, though more fulfilling than transactional employment. Building cooperative culture takes time and persistence, many people are ideologically committed but struggle with practical follow-through.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                
<p>The most important takeaway from Madison MAN is that mutual aid isn't just helping neighbors, it's building alternative economic systems that value human time and lives equally. This requires genuine commitment and sustained social effort, but creates more fulfilling relationships and community than traditional economic models. The work is challenging and requires showing up consistently, but it offers a path toward cooperative economies where everyone's time and contributions are valued equally.</p>
