                <p>Tog Hackerspace is an entirely volunteer and member run collective in Dublin, Ireland, where makers, hackers, and creators share resources, knowledge, and space. The name comes from the Irish word "tóg," meaning "to build or construct." Founded in 2009 by fifteen people who had visited similar spaces elsewhere in Europe, Tog emerged from a simple desire: to create a truly open space that would be available around the clock and welcoming to any type of project or interest.</p>
                
                <p>The space operates on two core principles, that it is run by its members, for its members, and that it is a non-commercial space. Decisions are made through consensus, which ensures that Tog remains responsive to the needs and values of its community rather than being controlled by a board or small leadership group. The group also makes it clear that it is not a coworking space or startup incubator. Members can work on personal and private projects, but commercial work or activities done for payment are generally not allowed, making it a space for experimentation and exploration, not profit.</p>
                
                <p>Today, Tog serves around 100 active members ranging from college students to retirees. Members typically contribute €55 per month, but this is a sliding scale system that can go as low as €20 for those who need financial accommodation. This covers the costs of rent, utilities, insurance, equipment, and internet. This pooled funding model makes expensive resources accessible. Members gain 24/7 access to an impressive array of equipment spanning multiple disciplines: woodworking, metalwork, coding, electronics, 3D printing, laser cutting, sewing and fabric work, fermentation, radio broadcasting, and much more. The diversity of tools reflects the hackerspace philosophy that creativity and making shouldn't be confined to any single medium or approach, and the space is truly open to any project.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond serving its members, Tog has a strong commitment to community outreach. The space regularly conducts programming with local schools, operates a community radio station, and hosts a weekly free open night. Tog also runs monthly repair cafés where community members can bring broken items to be fixed by skilled volunteers for free, building repair skills and community connections while also reducing waste.</p>

            <h2 class="subsection-title">How to Build Something Similar</h2>
            <div class="how-to-build">
                <p>Starting a full-fledged hackerspace like Tog requires many resources, so first look for existing maker spaces, community workshops, or tech collectives in your area. Joining and helping to grow an existing space is often more feasible and impactful than starting from scratch.</p>
                
                <p>If there are no maker spaces in your area, you can start building that community yourself. For most people, running a repair café is a much more accessible starting point than trying to open a full hackerspace. A repair café is a free community gathering where people bring broken household items such as appliances, clothing, electronics, bicycles, furniture, and toys, and work with skilled volunteers to repair them for free. These events reduce waste, preserve repair knowledge, build community connections, and help save money.</p>
                
                <p><strong>To run your own repair café:</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Find a venue:</strong> Libraries, community centers, churches, and cafés often have free or low-cost space available. Look for a place with tables, electrical outlets, and ideally some natural light.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Recruit volunteers:</strong> Spread the word in your community for people with repair skills. This could be sewers, electricians, woodworkers, tech enthusiasts, and general tinkerers. You don't need certified professionals, many excellent repair café volunteers are simply people who enjoy fixing things, and you would be surprised at the skills that many have.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Gather basic supplies:</strong> Often volunteers can bring much of their own equipment, but make sure that all bases are covered. Also, think about liability for equipment, especially equipment that is dangerous to use. You may wish to have people sign a simple waiver to avoid complications.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Set expectations clearly:</strong> Make it known that this is collaborative repair, not a drop-off service. Items might not always be fixable, but volunteers will do their best and help owners understand what went wrong.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Create a welcoming atmosphere:</strong> Provide refreshments if possible, arrange seating for waiting and socializing, and foster a learning environment where questions are encouraged. For the community to grow this has to be more than a service, it needs to be a space that people wish to be in.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Start simple and grow:</strong> Begin with one event and see what works. You can always add more dates, recruit more volunteers, and expand your toolkit based on community response.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Repair cafés often become the seed for larger maker communities. As people meet regularly, discover shared interests, and build trust, the foundation for something like a full hackerspace can naturally develop.</p>
